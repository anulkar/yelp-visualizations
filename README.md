# Data Science Project: Visualizing Yelp's Dataset

## Rationale  

Explore and communicate insights from Yelp's businesses and tips dataset for one city, via an interactive web visualizations dashboard using a Bar chart, Map plot, Scatter plot, Gauge chart, and Word Cloud.

## Dataset
* [Yelp's Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)
* [Documentation](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main)
  * `business.json`: Contains business data including location data, attributes, and categories.
  * `tips.json`: Tips written by a user on a business. Tips are shorter than reviews and tend to convey quick suggestions.

## Tools/Technologies
* Python-Flask powered RESTFUL API
* MongoDB
* HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
* AnyChart(https://www.anychart.com/)
* [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/)
* Python/Pandas and Excel to call the data, understand it, cleanse/manipulate it and create task specific JSON's
