# Data Science Project: Visualizing Yelp's Dataset

## Rationale  

Explore and communicate insights from Yelp's businesses and tips dataset for one city, via an interactive web visualizations dashboard using a Bar chart, Map plot, Scatter plot, Gauge chart, and Word Cloud.

## Dataset
* [Yelp's Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)
* [Documentation](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main)
  * `business.json`: Contains business data including location data, attributes, and categories.
  * `tips.json`: Tips written by a user on a business. Tips are shorter than reviews and tend to convey quick suggestions.
